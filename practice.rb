# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another â€“ the first 
# transaction is the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".

# It should print out:
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 8000
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Jeff's KelloggCoin balance is 2650
